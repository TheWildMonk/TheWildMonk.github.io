  It's my day 17 and it's getting really really tough with all those new OOP concepts mixed
  with procedural programming. But, to be honest, I'm actually enjoying it now! And I guess

  Today's goal was to make a quiz game project & learn more about how to make our own
  classes and objects. The final output of the project was to ask user for True/False 
  answer against a random question. Based on whether the user answered correctly or 
  wrong, user will get 1/0 point. There was in total of 12 questions which was randomly 
  selected with the help of python's random module. And at the end of 12 questin, the 
  user will get final result based on how many questions the user got right. Here is the 
  code snippet -</br>

<!-- Code Area -->
{% highlight python%}
from question_model import Question
from data import question_data
from quiz_brain import QuizBrain

question_bank = []
for question in question_data:
    question_bank.append(Question(question["text"], question["answer"]))

quiz = QuizBrain(question_bank)
while quiz.still_has_question():
    quiz.next_question()

print("You've completed the quiz.")
print(f"Your final score was: {quiz.score}/{quiz.question_number}")

  At the end of this project, Angella (the course instructor!) taught how to use
  <a href="https://opentdb.com/"><u>Open Trivaia Data Base</u></a>
  The question model & data were provided by Angella. These can be found 
  in my github repository for this project. </br>
  The full project can be accessed via my <a href="https://github.com/TheWildMonk/Quiz-Game-Project">github</a> repository. 
  With this and more, I'll post tomorrow again in sha Allah with a new concept I learned.
