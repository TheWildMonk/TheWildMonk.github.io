<!-- Post Introduction -->
<p class="font-weight-500">
  Who hasn't played the most popular <strong>Snake Game</strong> that came out with almost all 
  Nokia phones in the 90s'? In today's project, we recreated that same snake game with python 
  using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">turtle graphics</a>. 
</p>

  In part 1 of the project, we will find out how to create the snake's body, move the snake and user control to 
  change the direction of the snake to either up, down, left or right.
  </br>  
</P>

<!-- Post Content -->
<P class="font-weight-500">
  After setting up the main.py file by importing all the initial modules for the project, we have to create  
  a new module named snake.py which will be used to ceate the snake class with certain attributes & methods.
  </br>  
</P>

<P class="font-weight-500">
  At first we need to import turtle graphics to the snake.py. Then certain constants need to be declared 
  to use in methods of Snake class.
</P>

<!-- Code Area -->
{% highlight python%} 
  from turtle import Turtle

  SNAKE_MOVEMENT = 20
  UP = 90
  DOWN = 270
  RIGHT = 0
  LEFT = 180
{% endhighlight %}

<!-- Post Content -->
<P class="font-weight-500">
  Here, the SNAKE MOVEMENT constant is the speed of the snake with which it will move. And the rest are used 
  to change the direction of snake's head. </br>

  After the constant declaration, the Snake class is initiated with a list to hold each part of snake's 
  body as an object and a method to create parts of the snake.

<!-- Post Content -->
<P class="font-weight-500">
  The <strong>create_snake()</strong> method actually clones the initial turtle object 3 times with the help of a for loop. 
  With each iteration, at first a clone of the initial turtle object is created, then with the 
  <strong>goto()</strong> method of turtle, the cloned part is moved by 20 pixels behind the previous snake body part. This 
  is because the default turtle object is 20 px in width and 20 px in height. In this way, the next body part 
  of the snake will get attached to the previous body part. And finally, the cloned body part is appended to 
  the list <strong>snake_body</strong>. After the iteration is done, the initial turtle object needs to be hidden so that when 
  the snake moves on the turtle screen, the initial turtle object doesn't show up.

          turtle_object = Turtle("square")

              self.snake_body.append(new_shape)

<!-- Post Content -->
<P class="font-weight-500">
  This part here is the trickiest part. The snake needs to move in a way, so that, if it changes the direction 
  of the head, the rest of the body will follow. For this reason, we need to move each part of the snake to the 
  second last position of the snake. If we just try to move each part independantly, then when the head of the 
  snake will change it's direction, the reast of the body parts will not follow the head, rather it will keep 
  moving to the last direction of the head. 
  </br>  
</P>

<!-- Post Content -->
<P class="font-weight-500">
  Inside of the <strong>move()</strong> method, we'll initiate a for loop with a range from length of the 
  <strong>snake_body</strong> list to 0 with step of -1. Then we'll grab hold of the x-coordinate and y-coordinate 
  of the last position of the second last body part of the sanke. And then move the last body part to the position 
  of the second last body part. In this way, when the snake's head changes it's direction, the next body part of 
  the snake will follow the head. 
  </br>

{% highlight python%} 
  def move(self):
          for snake_part in range(len(self.snake_body) - 1, 0, -1):
              new_x_cor = self.snake_body[snake_part - 1].xcor()
              new_y_cor = self.snake_body[snake_part - 1].ycor()
              self.snake_body[snake_part].goto(new_x_cor, new_y_cor)
          self.head.forward(SNAKE_MOVEMENT)
{% endhighlight %}

  In the main.py, we'll import the snake module and create a snake object. Then, to negate the screen update 
  each time our snake moves, we will use the 
  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.tracer"><strong>tracer()</strong></a> 
  method of the screen and set the argument to 0. Then, we'll create a while loop to continue the game.
  To break the while loop, we'll set a trigger <strong>end_game</strong>.
  </br>  
</P>

<!-- Post Content -->
<P class="font-weight-500">
  Inside the while loop, we'll call the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.update"><strong>update()</strong></a> 
  method to update the screen everytime our snake moves. Then, we'll have to import the time module of python. 
  We have used the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html?highlight=sleep#time.sleep"><strong>sleep()</strong></a> 
  method of the time module which takes 1 argument; time as millisecond as the speed of our snake. We'll have 
  to declare a variable <strong>game_speed</strong> and set it's value 0.1. Then inside the <strong>sleep()</strong> 
  method, we'll pass the variable.
  </br>  
</P>

<!-- Post Content -->
<P class="font-weight-500">
  After that, we'll call the <strong>move()</strong> method which will initiate the snake to move forward.

<h5 class="entry-title mb-20 font-weight-900 text-center" style="text-transform: uppercase;"><u>User Control</u></h5>
<!-- Post Content -->
<P class="font-weight-500">
  We'll use turtle's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.listen"><strong>listen()</strong></a> 
  method to listen for key strokes and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.onkey"><strong>onkey()</strong></a> 
  method to set keys for the user to control the snake.
  </br>  
</P>

{% highlight python%} 
  # User control
  screen.listen()
  screen.onkey(snake.up, "Up")
  screen.onkey(snake.down, "Down")
  screen.onkey(snake.left, "Left")
  screen.onkey(snake.right, "Right")
{% endhighlight %}

<!-- Post Content -->
<P class="font-weight-500">
  The key names are case sensitive and needs to be same as name of keys of the keyboard. After declaring the 
  onkey() method, we'll create the up, down, left and right method inside our Snake class.
  </br>  
</P>

<!-- Code Area -->
{% highlight python%} 
  def up(self):
      if self.head.heading() != DOWN:
          self.head.setheading(UP)

  def down(self):
      if self.head.heading() != UP:
          self.head.setheading(DOWN)

  def right(self):
      if self.head.heading() != LEFT:
          self.head.setheading(RIGHT)

  def left(self):
      if self.head.heading() != RIGHT:
          self.head.setheading(LEFT)
{% endhighlight %}

<P class="font-weight-500">
  The conditional checks are there so that the snake can't reverse it's heading and move in the opposite direction 
  when the user strokes opposit direction key. We have now successfully created our snake and user control to move the snake up, down, left & right. And 
  here's the full code snippet of main.py for today -

  The full project can be accessed via my <a href="https://github.com/TheWildMonk/snake-game-project" target="_blank"><u>github</u></a> repository.
  With a monk like mind and a hand full of wild codes, I'll post tomorrow again in sha Allah for the second part of the snake game.
