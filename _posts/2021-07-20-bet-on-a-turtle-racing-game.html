<!-- Post Introduction -->
<p class="font-weight-500">
  From a very young age, I have heard about all kind of racing games like cars, bikes, horses all the way up to 
  dogs; on which people bet! But have you ever heard about betting on a <strong>turtle racing</strong>? If not, then let me show 
  you where you can!
</p>

  In this project, we have hands on practice of the an object state and multiple instances. The objective of the project is to 
  create a game where 6 different colored turtles will race against each other. But before the race begins, an user can bet on 
  which of the 6 turtle will win. Based on the winner, at the end of the race, the user will get to know whether he/she is a winner 
  or not.
  </br>
  Initially I've set up the color base with a list of colors and take user input to place a bet on a certain colored turtle.

{% highlight python%} 
  # Color base
  colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "maroon", "orange"]

  # While loop terminator
  race_end = False

  # User input for placing a bet
  user_bet = screen.textinput(title="Make your bet", prompt="Who will win the race? Pick up a color from "
                                                            "'red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'maroon', 'orange': ")

  The while loop terminator is initiated at the beginning of the program so that it prevents our while loop to not start 
  before the user is still deciding on what to bet on. 
  </br>
  After taking the user input, I've set an if..else statement just to check whether the user's bet is a valid color from 
  our list or not. If it's not valid, the program will exit and let the user know that it's not a valid color from our 
  colored turtles.
  </br>
  But if the user bets on a color from our color base, the race will begin. For that, at first I've generated 6 turtle 
  objects with different color from our color base and appended the turtle objects in a list. After that, I've used the 
  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.hideturtle"><u>hideturtle()</u></a> method to hide the 
  initially created turtle object. Then I've set the position of each turtle at the beginning of race line using the turtle 
  graphic's built in method <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.goto">
  <u>goto()</u></a>
  </br>

  And finally a while loop to set on the racing. With the help of python's random module, I've set the pace 
  of each turtle binding them inside a for loop.
  </br>
  After the first turtle that crosses the right edge of the screen, the race ends, and the user can see the 
  result of his/her bet on the result prompt. Here's the code snippet of the whole project -

  The full project can be accessed via my <a href="https://github.com/TheWildMonk/Turtle-Race-Project" target="_blank"><u>github</u></a> repository.
  With this and more, I'll post tomorrow again in sha Allah about some new topic that I'll learn from the course.
