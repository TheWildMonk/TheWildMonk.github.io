<!-- Post Introduction -->
<p class="font-weight-500">
  I don't know a bit about art. Back in school days, we had arts & crafts and I
  loved to sketch. But if I would know an art can make me this amount of money, 
  I would've concentrated on that rather than spending a bit on anything else.

  However, all frustrations apart, today I've made a program that can make me a million (!) in 
  seconds like <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist-series/damien-hirst-spots" target="_blank"><u>Damien Hirst</u></a>
  does.</br>
  The objective of today's project was to create a spot painting with randomly picked colors from 
  the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/colorgram.py/"><u>colorgram</u></a> python library. The target
  was to create a 10x10 dots on the turtle graphic canvas and create a painting similar to the following 
  image of Mr. Hirst ðŸ˜„.

</figure></br>

<p>It took me around <strong>1 Hour</strong>
  to figure out the nitty gritty of the project and to implement it on the canvas.
  Here's the code snippet -</br>
