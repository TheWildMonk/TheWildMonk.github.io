<!-- Post Introduction -->
<p class="font-weight-500">
  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.listen" target="_blank">Event listeners</a> in 
  turtle graphic is a great way to engage an user to do something on the turtle screen. In today's 
  lesson, we learned about Event Listeners, Higher Order Functions, State & instances in python.

  The first part of today's lesson had an exercise to make an Etch a Sketch game where an user 
  can use several keys to move the turtle to draw. In this project, we learned how to use higher 
  order function. A higher order function is a function that takes another function as an arguement. 
  By using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.onkey" target="_blank">screen.onkey()</a> 
  method, I've created the movements of the turtle. While working though this project, I've also gave 
  thought about using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.onkeypress" target="_blank">
  turtle.onkeypress()</a> function, and so, I've created another brunch on github just for this 
  experiment. <strong>AND IT WORKED!!!</strong> ðŸ˜… Here's the code snippet -

<!-- Code Area -->
{% highlight python%} 
  from turtle import Turtle, Screen

  # Creating necessary objects
  tim = Turtle()
  screen = Screen()
  tim.speed("fastest")


  # Functions for the movement
  def move_fd():
      tim.forward(10)


  def move_bk():
      tim.backward(10)


  def move_cw():
      tim.right(10)


  def move_ccw():
      tim.left(10)


  def world_clear():
      tim.clear()
      tim.penup()
      tim.home()
      tim.pendown()


  # Call the listen method for Screen
  screen.listen()

  # Call the onkey method for the movements of turtle
  screen.onkey(key="w", fun=move_fd)
  screen.onkey(key="s", fun=move_bk)
  screen.onkey(key="a", fun=move_cw)
  screen.onkey(key="d", fun=move_ccw)
  screen.onkey(key="c", fun=world_clear)

  # Screen exit method
  screen.exitonclick()

{% endhighlight %}

  The full project can be accessed via my <a href="https://github.com/TheWildMonk/Etch-A-Sketch-Project" target="_blank"><u>github</u></a> repository.
  There is another <a href="https://github.com/TheWildMonk/Etch-A-Sketch-Project/tree/continuousDrawing" target="_blank">branch</a> where I've used the continuous drawing method with the help of turtle.onkeypress() 
  method.</br>
  With this and more, I'll post tomorrow again in sha Allah and will share what I'll learn tomorrow.
