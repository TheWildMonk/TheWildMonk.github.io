<!-- Post Introduction -->
<p class="font-weight-500">
  While wondering how I should achieve my goal to become a data scientist and where I should start, one day suddently
  a facebook ad popped up on my phone screen. A COURSE ON UDEMY! 
</p>

  Most of the day, I used to scroll by those annoying ads, but this time it caught my attention. A bootcamp? For 100 days?
  On Python? Oooh.....</br>
  
  Back in 2018, I first started learning python, but gave up after just 3 days when the course instructor told to find out
  the prime number through code. üòÜ I know, right? But this course here caught my attention. So I thought of watching the
  preview of the course, and there.....Angella Yu, the course instructor of the well known python course on Udemy - 
  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/">100 days of code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp 2021</a> struck me hard. 
  She mentioned the journey of these hundred days in such a way, I had to enroll in as I was enthusiastic about programming since my graduation 
  life though I'm a EEE graduate [Ehem ehem...]</br>

  However, here I am in my 30s' and on 15th day of the course. As I created this blog merely to share my journey to become a data
  scientist, I give it a thought about sharing all the projects I have to do in my journey, what I learn and several topics regarding
  data science. </br>

  The project of Day 15 was a coffee machine project through procedural programming. And I have done this! üòÅ ON MY OWN!
  I seriously gave a pat on my back when I did this. Here's the code snippet.
