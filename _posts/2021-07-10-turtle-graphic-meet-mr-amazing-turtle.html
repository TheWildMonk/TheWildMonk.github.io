<!-- Post Introduction -->
<p class="font-weight-500">
  Human mind thrives to fill their eyes. Whenever, we see something beautiful, we 
  tend to freeze the moment for our eyes. And <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">
  <u>Turtle graphics</u></a> is how programming meets the eyes of a newbie python 
  programmer.

  Amid all these colorless python codes and projects, though we have built some
  amzing projects, the color was missing. It was all just blocks of codes which
  creates an output that we desire.</br>
  But today was different. And today, we met Mr. Turtle of the built in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html"><u>python
  library</u></a>. <strong>FINALLY SOME COLORS!</strong></br>
  As I have started blogging from day 15 of the course, but I actually faced a
  similar kind of object back when the course was teaching us functions. It was the
  <a href="https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html" target="_blank">Reeborg's world</a>.</br>
  But <strong>turtle graphics</strong> is way more fun. In today's section, there were 
  challenges in several steps to adapt with the flow. 1st challenge was to draw a simple
  square (this was just the warmup) and gradually we created dashed line, <a href="https://github.com/TheWildMonk/turtle-graphic-geometry-shape" target="_blank"><u>different shapes</u></a>, 
  random walk etc etc...</br>

  Then we took part in a bit difficult exercise which was to draw a spirograph.

  The final task of this section is to create a <a href="https://www.damienhirst.com/artworks/catalogue?category=1&p=0"><u>Hirst Spot Painting</u></a></br>
  With that project and more, I'll post tomorrow again in sha Allah and will share my thoughts with you.
